// Developer:   Cory Wyman
// Date:        9/12/2016
// Description: Initial code

// Developer:       Kyle Aycock
// Date:            10/7/2016
// Description:     NOTE: I kind of reworked this script to serve as more of a general ship controller - it controls health, respawning, & collisions
//                  Added ChangeHealth function to avoid clogging the update loop with needless health checks
//                  Added several public variables for interfacing with health UI, camera
//                  Changed existing code to use ChangeHealth function, Health UI
//                  Added code for death animation, switching camera modes to orbital on death
//                  Fixed cannonball collision code - however, cannonballs need to be nocollided with the ship collider!
//                  Added cannonball explosions!
//                  Changed public variables organized into groups because there's too many
//                  Changed OnTriggerEnter to OnCollisionEnter because the cannonballs are not triggers

//Developed:		Kyle Chapman
//Date:				10/20/2016
//Description:		Added hurt self button and enabled multiplayer functionality.

// Developer:       Kyle Aycock
// Date:            10/21/2016
// Description:     Fixed cannonball collisions for networking
//                  Cleaned up code a bit
//                  Added code to support health bars above other ships

//Developer:        Kyle Aycock
//Date:             11/3/2016
//Description:      Haphazardly threw in much network-related functionality. Requires cleanup
//                  Moved Death and Respawn procedures to separate methods
//                  Added nametag support
//                  Updated CmdChangeHealth to communicate with server manager on death
//                  Added CmdPlayerInit, the purpose of which is to tell the server the player was successfully spawned
//                  Added RpcEndGame and RpcRestartGame which communicate with new elements of the main Canvas object

//Developer:        Kyle Aycock
//Date:             11/9/2016
//Description:      Cleaned up documentation to be more friendly to developers who need to understand how this script works
//                  Made small changes to CmdPlayerInit to match the new system

//Developer:        Erick Ramirez Cordero
//Date:             11/9/2016
//Description:      Added the defenseStat variable to influence damage calculation. When the player
//                  chooses to allocate crew members to defense, the defense stat should be updated
//                  by the Crew Management Script.

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        2/1/2017
// Description: Adapted to use new Team system
//              Added code to trigger appropriate Player events

// Developer:   Kyle Chapman
// Date:        2/14/2017
// Description: Refactored for interaction with the InteractiveObjects system.

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        4/6/2017
// Description: Fixed connectionId bug on this script
