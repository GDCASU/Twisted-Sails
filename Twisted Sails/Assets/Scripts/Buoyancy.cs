    Description:
        Makes objects float on water. Adjusts drag of objects based on current situation (above, on, or below water).

    Guidelines of use:

        Mass doesn't affect how the object floats (Because I used ForceMode.Acceleration rather than ForceMode.Force), just how fast the object falls when in the air.
        Drag is adjusted automatically based on the situation of the object. Drag values for above, on, and below water can be configured in Unity.
        Upward Force needs to be above gravity (currently 9.81) for the object to float to the top of the water at all
            Recommending 10
            Less than gravity will cause object to sink
            Over 15ish looks weird, but could be used as a one time thing to shoot objects out of the water (recommending >100 for this)

    This script should now perform a raycast to the water mesh and set the current water height equal to the point at which the raycast
    hits. The ray is cast from an arbitrary high point above the boat and looks for colliders not marked as terrain. When one is found, the water level for the
    bouyancy algorithm is set to the height of the point that the ray hits. In Scene view, a line will be drawn from the boat to where it thinks the water is

    Now references Vector3.up, rather than transform.up.
