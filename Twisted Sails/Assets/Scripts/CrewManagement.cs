/**
// This script handles the crew management stat allocation system. When one stat is raised, the 
// other two stats are lowered as a form of balance. Additionally, there is a cooldown 
// timer in place before the player can select another stat modification. This script also updates
// the Crew Management User Interface for the player to visually see the state of their ship.

// Initial Author:  Erick Ramirez Cordero
// Initial Version: September 12, 2016

// Update:      Erick Ramirez Cordero
// Date:        October 2, 2016
// Description: Button and UI input reading have been moved to the new CrewUserInterface script.
//              This script is responsible for stat calculations and the cooldown timer. The code
//              that checked for stats remaining between the minimum and maximum is now located
//              under the new CheckStatLimits() function.

// Update:      Erick Ramirez Cordero
// Date:        November 9, 2016
// Description: First attempt at connecting the Crew Management feature to the boat. The three
//              stats are now multipliers that have four positive and four negative stages.
//              When the player allocates members to a crew, the stat chosen is augmented by
//              two stages while the other two stats fall by one stage. The CheckStatsLimits()
//              function has been replaced by the CheckStage() and StatUpdate() functions.

// NOTE (UI):   This script now handles calculations AND the User Interface again.
//              Due to this, this script is now networked and the CrewManagementUserInterface 
//              script should NOT be used.

// NOTE:        Due to how stats are calculated, speed improves when its stage rises (larger
//              multiplier) while fire rate and defense improve when their stages fall (smaller
//              multipliers).

// Speed:       Influences the Acceleration of the ship. The higher the currentSpeed, the faster
//              the ship should move.
//              The BoatMovementNetworked script uses currentSpeed.

// Fire Rate:   Influences the Fire Delay of the ship's cannons. The lower the currentFireRate,
//              the faster the cannons should be able to fire.
//              The BroadsideCannonFireNetworked script uses currentFireRate.

// Defense:     Influences damage calculation. The lower the currentDefense, the less damage a
//              ship takes from the enemy.
//              The Health script uses currentDefense.
