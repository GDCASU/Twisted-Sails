/**
//9th Oct 16 Scotty Molt 
//	- Networked movement and attach camera on Start()
//	- Attempt to fire cannons from here instead of from BroadsideCannonFire
//	- Changed cannonball scale to static, on init in CannonBallNetworked
//	- Updated default values to Inspector values
//	11th Oct
//	-	Implemented BoatInput struct in preparation for sending input to server
//	-	Added BoatState struct, does nothing yet

// Update:      Erick Ramirez Cordero
// Date:        Novemeber 9, 2016
// Description: Added the speedStat variable to influence boat movement. When the player chooses
//              to allocate crew members to speed, the speed stat should be updated by the Crew
//              Management Script.

// Update:      Edward Borroughs
// Date: January 27, 2016
// Description: Added swivel gun functionality as a special case of the normal broadside cannons.
//              Mouse0 (left click) was added to the list of inputs and is used to fire the 
//              swivel guns. A bool "fireSwivelGun" was added to the BoatInput struct and the bool 
//              "fire" was changed to "fireCannon". The array of cannons "cannonScripts" was 
//              increased in size from 8 to 9. Modified FixedUpdate() to rotate the swivel gun to 
//              the same angle as the boat camera.

// Update:      Edward Borroughs
// Date: February 1, 2016
// Description: Refactored the code. Now BroadsideCannonFireNetworked is in charge of instantiating 
//              fired cannon balls on the server and this code takes that instance and spawns it on
//              the other clients.
