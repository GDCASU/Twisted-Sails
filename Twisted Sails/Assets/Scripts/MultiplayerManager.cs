// Developer: Kyle Aycock
// Date: 11/3/2016
// This is a class inheriting from the default Unity NetworkManager that should be used
// to make changes to the way NetworkManager operates. It is extremely helpful to reference
// the code for Unity's NetworkManager which can be found open source at this link:
// https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/networking/
//
// This class is currently serving as a general multiplayer game controller. The functionality
// of the default NetworkManager has been extended to make it easier to work with.
// Also included are two enums and several message classes that I didn't feel deserved their own file.
// Added code for broadcasting current game state (score, player stats, etc) to all players whenever
// a change is made. This may be inefficient, but it's okay for now. At the very least it's needed
// for when a new player joins, to synchronize the current game state with that player and tell everyone
// else that a new player has joined. Also added stuff to help with the scoreboard and score feed.

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        11/10/2016
// Description: Expanded to include lobby functionality
//              Fixed a bunch of stuff to allow more control over when/what the player object spawns in

// Developer:   Nizar Kury
// Date:        11/17/2016
// Description: Expanded to include ship selection
//              - Modified SpawnMessage
//              - Added localShipType
//              

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        1/11/2016
// Description: Added a selection of convenience methods that should be used by other scripts
//              to interact with the MultiplayerManager. The intention is that if another programmer
//              needs to do something with networking, they may simply refer to the static methods either here
//              or in the autocomplete and find the one that does what they need to do. Will most likely need to
//              be expanded upon after designers start doing more stuff and the need for more methods arises.
//              Documentation will be written to aid with this.

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        1/26/2017
// Description: Adapted this class to work with new Gamemode and Team classes
//              Fixed a bug having to do with starting a session after ending one without restarting the client
//              Fixed a bug having to do with hosting a game after previously joining one
//              Added several events for use by other coders
//              Added code to trigger Player's events at appropriate times
//              Fixed a bug preventing player ship choice from being sent to the server

// Developer:   Diego Wilde
// Date:        2/19/2017
// Description: Player data persistence functionality added. Player statistics are currently saved clientside 
//              using binary incription to the PlayerData.gd file. Save is called whenever the game scene 
//              changes clientside, and loading is performed once during OnClientConnect().
//              - Added method to get the local player

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        2/24/2017
// Description: Minor changes to work with new lobby.

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        3/23/2017
// Description: Fixed bug having to do with Unity networking keeping separate
//              connectionIds on client and server.

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        3/24/2017
// Description: Added functionality for team-based spawn points

// Developer:   Kyle Aycock
// Date:        4/6/2017
// Description: Fixed bug where a player sometimes wouldn't be spawned in because the server still detected their lobby object
//              Fixed bug where players would sometimes send spawn messages before the server collected spawn points, causing players to not spawn in
//              Fixed connectionId bug on ships, fix was only applied to lobby objects previously
