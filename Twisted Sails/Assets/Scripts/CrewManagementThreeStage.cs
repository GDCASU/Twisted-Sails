/**
// This version of the Crew Management system uses a three-stage system as opposed to the
// plus-minus system originally created. The player will have three points (crew members)
// to allocate to their ship at any point in the match. When all three points are allocated,
// points need to be removed before new points can be allocated. The player can either select
// a stat to remove a point from, or the player can press a "Reset" button to remove all points
// at once.

// Note:        The base stat represents a multiplier of one, and every point added to a stat
//              raises the multiplier by one. Due to this, stats should not have a negative
//              effect (drop below one).

// Attack:      Influences the fire delay of the ship's cannons.
// Defense:     Influences damage calculation.
// Speed:       Influences the acceleration of the ship.

// CrewCount:   Keeps track of the current amount of crew members (points) available.
//              Starting amount and maximum are three points, and points can be regained by
//              removing a point from a stat.
