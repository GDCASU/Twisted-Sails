    Duplicate this script and rename the duplicate
	to place on a boat prefab game object.
    Each boat type should have a different heavy weapon script
    associated with it. For instance, a trireme would have a 
    TriremeHeavyWeapon script while the dragon boat would have
    a DragonBoatHeavyWeapon script attached to it.

	If need help using this template, contact the programmer's above.
